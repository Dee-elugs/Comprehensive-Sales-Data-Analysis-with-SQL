# 🗄 SQL Project – Customer, Supplier, and Order Analysis

A collection of SQL queries designed to explore, transform, and analyze customer, supplier, and order data from a dataset named **`Project`**.  
This project demonstrates data selection, aggregation, filtering, and transformation techniques for business insights.

💻 Developed using PostgreSQL

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project is designed to:

- Practice SQL querying for business reporting and analytics.
- Explore various **SELECT** statements with filtering, ordering, grouping, and aggregate functions.
- Transform and clean data for more insightful reporting.
- Apply real-world SQL operations such as altering table structures and updating column values.

---

## 📦 What's Included

The SQL scripts include:

- **Basic SELECT Statements**
  - Retrieve customer and supplier details by country.
  - Combine first and last names into a single field.
  - Filter by country or product name patterns.
  - Order results alphabetically or by numeric columns.

- **Conditional Queries**
  - Use of `CASE` to display product availability.
  - Search products by package type (e.g., bottles).

- **Aggregation & Grouping**
  - Count distinct customers, suppliers, and products.
  - Group by supplier or customer location.
  - Filter groups using `HAVING` clauses (e.g., suppliers with >3 products).

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
  - Alter column data types for better accuracy.
  - Format `Total_amount` values into currency and back into numeric.
  - Calculate averages and filter based on numeric ranges.

- **Date-based Analysis**
  - Calculate total sales and order counts for specific date ranges.
